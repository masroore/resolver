
Conways Game of Life in a Resolver spreadsheet.

    Concieved as an exercise in using third party code within Resolver.
    Consequentially, grid state is stored within the stand-alone module
    'life.py' (which can be exercised from the command-line using 'lifeCli.py')

    The grid is updated every recalc (use F9)
